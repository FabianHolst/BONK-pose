### A 6D Pose Estimation Dataset for Marine Vessels
The BONK-pose dataset is a 6D pose estimation dataset for marine vessels, created by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. It addresses the gap in maritime datasets by providing fully annotated 3D bounding boxes for vessel pose estimation. 

BONK-pose doesn't rely on human annotation effort, the 6D poses are instead derived by a data fusion algorithm, that corrects and enriches pose information of a AIS base prior.

The dataset consists of 3,753 images with 3D bounding box annotations including location, vessel dimensions and orientation. In those images 3,829 vessel are annotated.
